# KHC Engaged Learning Experience — Proposal Draft

## Project Title
AI-Assisted Code Optimization Using Control Flow Graphs

## Description (Goal/Objective)
Build a tool that analyzes a program’s Control Flow Graph (CFG) and suggests optimizations (e.g., dead code elimination, inlining, loop unrolling) to improve performance.

## Methods
- Extract CFGs from LLVM IR generated by Clang
- Engineer CFG features and train a baseline ML model
- Evaluate improvements vs. LLVM `-O3`
- Build a small Flask UI to demo uploads → suggestions

## Timeline
See README; 12-week plan aligned with CPU 4990H.

## Deliverables
- Software tool + documentation
- Research paper (Honors)
- RSCA/CARS presentation

## IRB
Not applicable (no human/animal subjects).
